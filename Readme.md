Hello Daniel Massa,

From your description, it sounds like you need a web-based application that can manage and track a group of people using RFID chips. Here's a high-level overview of how such a system could be designed:

### System Components:
1. **RFID Chips**: These will be given to each individual in the group. Each chip has a unique identifier.
2. **RFID Reader**: This device will read the RFID chips. When a chip is scanned, the reader sends the chip's unique identifier to the software.
3. **Web-based Application**: This application will manage the data, including:
   - Registering each chip with a corresponding name.
   - Tracking the presence or absence of each individual.
   - Logging the time and location of each scan.
   - Displaying a list of individuals who are present and those who are missing.

### Workflow:
1. **Registration**:
   - Each person is given an RFID chip.
   - The chip is scanned using the RFID reader.
   - In the web application, the chip's unique identifier is linked to the person's name.

2. **Event Start**:
   - At the start of an event or journey, each person scans their chip.
   - The application logs the time and confirms their presence.

3. **Periodic Checks**:
   - At various points during the event or journey, you can request everyone to scan their chips again.
   - The application will update the list of present individuals and highlight anyone who is missing.

4. **End of Event**:
   - At the end, a final scan can be done to ensure everyone is accounted for.
   - The application can provide a summary, including any individuals who were missing at any point and the last known location/time they were scanned.

### Technical Solution:
1. **Backend**:
   - A server to host the web application.
   - A database to store the chip identifiers, names, and scan logs.
   - APIs to interact with the RFID reader and update the database.

2. **Frontend**:
   - A user-friendly interface to register chips, view the list of individuals, and see who is missing.
   - Real-time updates when a chip is scanned.

3. **RFID Integration**:
   - The RFID reader should be compatible with the server and able to send scan data in real-time.

### Next Steps:
1. **Hardware Selection**: Choose an RFID reader that can integrate with web applications.
2. **Software Development**: Develop the web application based on the described workflow.
3. **Testing**: Test the system in a controlled environment before deploying it for real events.

Would you like to proceed with this solution? If so, we can start by analyzing any existing code repositories you have or begin the development from scratch.
